Put any notes for us here  
(If you feel you need to explain how / why you did something the way you did):

I completed parts I - III. I added axios, lodash and moment as helper packages, and added bootstrap/react-bootstrap for some basic styling
Part IV seemed fairly straightforward and with another 30 - 40 minutes I am confident I would have been able to complete it. Part V is more advanced but also somethign I feel confident I would be able to complete with another hour or two. 
 
I would have liked to also add pages based on the total number of pages returned from the server, but wasn't able to in the alotted time.
